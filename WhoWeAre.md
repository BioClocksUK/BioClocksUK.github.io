Dr Robert Dallmann, Associate Professor of Chronomedicine, University of Warwick.

Our research is focused on the interplay between the internal biological timing system and diseases as well as their treatment. For example, clocks modulate drug uptake in the body and their excretion as well as metabolism. The perspective of this work includes to improve already existing treatments and to aid in the development of new drugs.

Antony Dodd is a circadian biologist who studies the role of the circadian clock in the responses of organisms to their fluctuating environments. The lab uses plants and microbes as their main experimental models. We are obtaining new fundamental insights into the integration of circadian timing cues with other types of environmental information, and have interests in the circadian control of photosynthesis, abiotic stress tolerance, and plant-microbe interactions.
