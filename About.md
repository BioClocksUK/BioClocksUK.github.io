### What is Bioclocks UK?

BioClocks UK is a hub for biological rhythm research in the UK, providing news, information and resources for researchers in the circadian community and the wider public. Over the last years, UK circadian research has delivered fascinating insights into fundamental biology driven by adaptation to life on a rotating planet. Research into circadian rhythms has direct applications in improving human health and wellbeing; providing insights into the treatment of circadian- and sleep-related disorders, the effect of disease, ageing and stress on our circadian clocks and informing targeted medicine. Circadian research also offers opportunities for building resilient and sustainable agricultural systems and improving food security. Across the UK, there are over 400 researchers delivering high-impact research into circadian rhythms across a wide variety of model systems (e.g. humans, flies, mice, fungi and plants). The strength of circadian research in the UK is due in part to the establishment and success of regular UK Clock Club meetings which have provided a basis for knowledge-exchange and collaboration in the circadian community.

### What is UK Clock Club?

The UK Clock Club has played a critical part in building a chronobiology research community in the UK. The first meeting of the series was held in 1983, and has since been held in over 12 different locations across the UK. Details of past Clock clubs and information about upcoming events can be found on the [Home](https://bioclocksuk.github.io/index) page.
