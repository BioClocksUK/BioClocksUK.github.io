title: BioClocks UK
---

Welcome to the online focus for UK research on biological clocks. 

Anyone recovering from jet lag, a change in work shifts, or an unusually early start, has run up against their own, 24-hour biological clock. Clocks control the living world, not just in humans but in all larger organisms and even some bacteria! Our [Resources](https://bioclocksuk.github.io/Resources) will help you to find out more, with [News](https://bioclocksuk.github.io/News) on meetings and events. 

Leading UK researchers are discovering what makes these clocks tick, and how they affect human society, agriculture and the environment. The map below shows where we work. You can learn more [About](https://bioclocksuk.github.io/About) this research area, about BioClocks UK, and [Who We Are](https://bioclocksuk.github.io/WhoWeAre) as its volunteers. 

Weâ€™re also working on a new website, which will soon be linked from here
